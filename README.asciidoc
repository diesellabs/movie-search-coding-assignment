= Movie Search Coding Assignment

== Assignment
Develop a movie search web application which allows the user to search a movie by name

== Features
Some of the features which would be good to have are:

1. The user should be able search by entering a movie name and the resulting table should return display the movie with various attributes
2. Provide a auto completion/suggestion functionality based on movie name
3. Create endpoints to load the table, search and auto completions

== Data
A zipped csv file of variants is available in /data/ml-latest-small.zip. The datafile can also be downloaded from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/.
This datafile contains links.csv, movies.csv, ratings.csv and tags.csv. The expectations is the you will combine the links, ratings and tags for movies in movies.csv and present the combined data in your implementation. Ratings are averaged and aggregated by movie.
Feel free to store the data in the database of your choosing.

== Implementation
Please choose the language/framework of your choice (python, java, c, scala, react, vue, etc). You may use any additional frameworks, languages, databases, libraries, etc. that you find appropriate.

Our expectation is you will be writing some server code, client code, and applying some basic styling to create a working web application. The application should include unit tests.

Below find the example of grouping and displaying the information
